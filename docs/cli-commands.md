# CLI Commands

This documents describes CLI commands and operators for using RLPG.
Due to the current stage in the development process, only a few
commands will be supported in the beginning.

`--filename [PATH]`:
This is a required parameter.
It describes the location of the input file to generate the lexer and parser.

`--output [PATH]`:
This is a required parameter.
It describes where to put the output file (the generated lexer and parser) on the local storage.
